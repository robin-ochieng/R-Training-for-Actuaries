Greetings Team,
In Lesson 3, we'll cover the following topics using the attached dataset:
a). Introduction to data manipulation with dplyr
b). Data visualization with ggplot2
 
 
Please ensure you complete the exercises below before our next meeting:
1. Load the 'Data_Excel' data into R.
2. Group the data by the 'Category' column, calculate the total 'Gross Paid' and 'Net Paid' for each category while excluding any missing values.
3. Convert the 'Gross Paid' column to Tanzanian shillings and store it in a new column named 'Gross_Paid_Tz'.
4. Filter out the data for the Marine class and save in a variable named "marine_data".
5. Exclude entries where 'Gross Paid' is greater than or equal to 200,000.
6. Select the 'Loss Date', 'Paid Date', and 'Statutory Class' columns from the dataset to create a dataset named 'selected_columns'.
7. Arrange the data by 'Claims' in descending order and save it to the variable 'arranged_data'.
8. Count the number of entries per 'Category' and save it to 'category_count'.
9. Retrieve the unique values of the 'Category' and save them to the variable 'distinct_category'.
8. Group the data by 'Category' and then summarize by 'Gross Paid'.
9. After grouping and summarizing by 'Gross Paid', use ggplot2 to create a bar plot where each bar represents a category, and the height represents the summed 'Gross Paid'.
10. Generate a scatter plot of 'Gross Paid' versus 'Net Paid' with points colored by 'Category' and add a linear regression line.
11. Generate a box plot to visualize the distribution of 'Gross Paid' across different 'Category' values.
