Greetings Team,

*In Lesson 2 of our R training, we'll cover the following topics using the attached datasets:

Importing data from various file formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).
Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
Managing missing values and outliers.
Exporting datasets from R to Excel and CSV formats.

*Please ensure you complete the exercises below before our next meeting:

1. Explore both Data_Excel and Data_CSV to understand their contents.
2. Import these datasets as Excel and CSV, respectively, in R.
3. Import the datasets in R as Excel and CSV formats using at least two different methods.
4. Check for the number of duplicate records in both datasets.
5. Extract the duplicated records from each dataset.
6. Remove duplicate records from the dataset.
7. Rename the `Statutory Class` column to Class.
8. Add a new column `Gross_Paid_Dollar` to convert values from KSH to USD in the `Gross Paid` column.
9. Count the missing values in the Gross Paid 2 column.
10. Handle the missing values by either imputation or removal.
11. Determine the number of outliers in the Gross Paid 2 column.
12. Extract rows that contain outliers in the Gross Paid 2 column.
13. Export these extracted outliers to Excel or CSV formats.

Looking forward to our session.
