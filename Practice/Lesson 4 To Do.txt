Hi team, 

In Lesson 4, we'll be dealing with dates and times. Please practice using the exercises below before our next meeting:

1. Ensure that all date columns ("Loss Date", "Reported", "Paid Date") are in Date format and not character, numeric, or factor types.
2. Compute the number of days between "Loss Date" and "Reported".
3. Compute the number of days between "Loss Date" and "Paid Date".
4. Extract the year from "Loss Date", "Paid Date", and "Reported" and create a summary per year.
5. Calculate the age of each claim by finding the difference between the current date and "Paid Date".
6. Create a subset of data for claims reported in the first quarter of any year.
7. Plot the trend of "Gross Paid" amounts by month.
8. Determine which claims were reported on weekends.
9. Calculate the number of days from "Reported" to "Paid Date" for each claim.
10. Extract the week number from "Loss Date" and create a summary of the number of claims per week.
11. Filter claims that were reported within a specific date range (e.g., between "2022-01-01" and "2023-12-01").
12. Create buckets for claim ages (e.g., 0-30 days, 31-60 days, etc.) and summarize the number of claims in each bucket by class.
13.Calculate the average number of claims reported each day.
14. Analyze the number of claims reported by day of the week.
15. Identify the top 10 claims with the longest duration between "Loss Date" and "Paid Date".
16. Calculate the quarterly trend of "NetPaid" amounts.
17. Calculate the median reporting delay for each month.
18. Find the maximum claim age for each "Statutory Class".
