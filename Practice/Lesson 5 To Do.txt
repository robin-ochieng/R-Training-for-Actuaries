Good Evening Team,

In Lesson 5, we'll be looking into the essentials of the tidyverse and specifically focusing on tidyr for data manipulation. Please check out the questions below for practice.

1.Write R code to separate "Loss Date" into "Loss_Year", "Loss_Month", and "Loss_Day".

2. How would you use R to combine "Loss_Year", "Loss_Month", and "Loss_Day" into a single "Loss Date"?

3. Write R code to count the missing values in "Gross Paid2", fill these missing values with zeros, and count the missing values again.

4. Transform "Gross Paid" and "Gross Paid2" from wide to long format in R, naming the new columns "Gross_Paid_Type" and "Gross_Paid_Amount".

5. Separate "1ST.TREATY", formatted as "TypeAmount" (e.g., "L5000"), into "Treaty_Type" and "Treaty_Amount", extracting the first character for type and the rest for amount.

6. First separate "Loss Date" into "Loss_Year_Month" and "Loss_Day", then further separate "Loss_Year_Month" into "Loss_Year" and "Loss_Month".

7. Combine "Claim_Identifier", "Category", "Loss Date", and "Statutory Class" into one column, separated by underscores.

8. Replace all NA values in "Gross Paid2" with zero.

9. Summarize the total "Gross Paid" by "Loss_Month" using R.

10. Group the data by "Category" and "Loss_Year", and summarize the total "Gross Paid" for each group.
